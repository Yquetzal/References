# Introduction to Python

## Getting started
If you do not have a computer science backgroud, and are not very familiar with programming, you can install the anaconda package distribution: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/ that comes with most library and tools you will need and a user interface to handle it. 
Otherwise, it is better to use the standard distribution of package, seems it gives you more control and can be easier to install some exotic packages.
You can easily find many tutorials on the internet, I do not know one in particular. In French, you can check https://python.developpez.com/cours/, in English: https://stackify.com/learn-python-tutorials/

## Tools
To learn the language, libraries and code small/medium size projects, I strongly recommend to use notebooks.
Most standard is jupyter https://jupyter.org
There are a few standalone apps, for instance I sometime use nteract: https://nteract.io

### Online notebooks
You can start coding in python in notebooks without installing anything using online notebooks, for instance the one of google, google collab: https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true
Or if you need more power, you can use the ones from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com

### IDE
If you want to code a large projects (e.g., >1000 lines of codes), an IDE might be useful. My favorite at this time is pycharm. I find it better than spyder, included in the anaconda distribution.
